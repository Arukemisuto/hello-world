# hello-world
First day programming
my name is manuel J.I I am a 20 year old entrepreneur learning to master as many skills as I can to catch people who put others peoples lives in dangers or believe it is their right to take away the inalienable rights of human beings and commit crimes against humanity with out any consequence.
I wrote this in order for the individual to understand what I hope to accomplish with programming skills.
